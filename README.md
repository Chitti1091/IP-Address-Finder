# IP-Address-Finder
Using a splay tree data structure, we can create a tree where each node represents the IP address of a device connected to a specific network router. In this implementation, we assume 11 devices are connected to a single router. Since all devices share a common network prefix in their IP addresses, only the unique portions of the addresses are stored in the nodes.
When the router receives specific data packets from the internet, it needs to forward them to the correct device based on its IP address. To optimize this process, we use a splay tree, which is one of the fastest data structures for search and insert operations. The splay tree reorganizes itself during searches, ensuring that frequently accessed IP addresses are moved closer to the root, thus speeding up future operations.
This implementation also uses a random function to generate data packets, eliminating the need for manual input. The process is fully automated, simulating how a router dynamically routes data packets to devices in a real-world network. By leveraging the efficiency of splay trees, the router can quickly locate and send data packets to the appropriate device, even when multiple devices are connected to the same network.
